  title: Lewisham Ward Profiles
---

In the run up to the elections in May 2022, Lewisham's political map is being redrawn. To provide information about the new areas being formed, we are working with community development to profile these areas.

## What are the main changes?

- Lewisham will now have 19 wards – 1 more than we currently have
- The boundaries of 2 wards will stay the same (Telegraph Hill and Forest Hill) – all others will change
- 2 wards will no longer exist – New Cross and Whitefoot
- We will have 3 brand new wards – Deptford, Hither Green and New Cross Gate
- 16 wards will have 3 councillors
- 3 wards will have only 2 councillors – Bellingham, Lewisham Central and New Cross Gate
- The total number of councillors will remain the same as previously
